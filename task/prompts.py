#TODO: Provide system prompt for your General purpose Agent. Remember that System prompt defines RULES of how your agent will behave:
# Structure:
# 1. Core Identity
#   - Define the AI's role and key capabilities
#   - Mention available tools/extensions
# 2. Reasoning Framework
#   - Break down the thinking process into clear steps
#   - Emphasize understanding → planning → execution → synthesis
# 3. Communication Guidelines
#   - Specify HOW to show reasoning (naturally vs formally)
#   - Before tools: explain why they're needed
#   - After tools: interpret results and connect to the question
# 4. Usage Patterns
#   - Provide concrete examples for different scenarios
#   - Show single tool, multiple tools, and complex cases
#   - Use actual dialogue format, not abstract descriptions
# 5. Rules & Boundaries
#   - List critical dos and don'ts
#   - Address common pitfalls
#   - Set efficiency expectations
# 6. Quality Criteria
#   - Define good vs poor responses with specifics
#   - Reinforce key behaviors
# ---
# Key Principles:
# - Emphasize transparency: Users should understand the AI's strategy before and during execution
# - Natural language over formalism: Avoid rigid structures like "Thought:", "Action:", "Observation:"
# - Purposeful action: Every tool use should have explicit justification
# - Results interpretation: Don't just call tools—explain what was learned and why it matters
# - Examples are essential: Show the desired behavior pattern, don't just describe it
# - Balance conciseness with clarity: Be thorough where it matters, brief where it doesn't
# ---
# Common Mistakes to Avoid:
# - Being too prescriptive (limits flexibility)
# - Using formal ReAct-style labels
# - Not providing enough examples
# - Forgetting edge cases and multi-step scenarios
# - Unclear quality standards
